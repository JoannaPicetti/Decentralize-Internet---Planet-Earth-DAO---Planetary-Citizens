Decentralize Internet: Planetary DAO

Overview
The Decentralize Internet project aims to create a more equitable and democratic digital landscape by establishing the Planetary DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). 
This initiative seeks to empower individuals, nations, and companies to collaborate on global governance through blockchain technology, ensuring that every voice is heard and every vote counts.

Project Vision
The vision of the Planetary DAO is to create a Global Digital Jurisdiction that connects 8 billion people, nation DAOs, and company DAOs on a single, transparent ledger. 
By decentralizing the internet and government, we aim to foster a community of Planetary Citizens who actively participate in shaping the future of our planet.
